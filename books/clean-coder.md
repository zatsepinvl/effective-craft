#### 2. Saying No
- Professionals speak truth to power.
- Do not hesitate to say no and face confrontation, 
the hard decisions are best made through the confrontation of adversarial roles.
- Do not provide too much details in case of adversarial conversation as it can be an invitation for micro-management.
- The higher the stakes, the more valuable "no" becomes.

- Forget about trying. Either you do or you do not.
- Be open, there is no place or time for passive aggression.

- The clients never care as much as you do.

#### 3. Saying Yes
- Make a commitment effectively:
    1. You say you'll do it.
    2. You mean it.
    3. You actually do it.
- Recognize lack of commitment around you, and in you.
- Change your language of commitment to solve the communication problem.
- Professionals live up to their words.
- Instead of committing to do impossible work (or if it depends on someone else), you should commit to these specific actions that bring you closer to the end goal.
- Change expectations as soon as possible.
- Do not abuse the word try. Say it clear, either you will or you wont.
- Do not break disciplines, it only slows you down.
- All commitments we make should be subordinate to the committed disciplines.
- Professionals know their limits.

#### 4. Coding
#####Preparedness
- Firstly, you must understand what problem you are solving. 
- Secondly, you must understand how to solve that problem.
- Your code must fit well into the existing system.
- You must craft the code in such a way that it reveals your intent.

#####Interruptions
- If you are tired or destructed, do not code. Dedication and professionalism are more about discipline that hours.
- Professional developers allocate their personal time in order to ensure that the time spent at office is as productive as possible.
- The professional attitude is a polite willingness to be helpful.

#####Creativity
- Remember that creativity breeds creativity.

#####Debugging
- It is incumbent upon you as a professional to reduce your debugging time as close to zero as you can get.

#####Pacing Yourself
- You must conserve your energy and creativity with the same care.
- Learn your patterns of creativity and brilliance, and take advantage of them rather than work against them.
- Disengagement allows your mind to hunt for solutions in a different and more creative way.
- Sometimes the best way to solve a problem is to go home, eat dinner, watch TV, go to bed, and then wake up the next morning and take a shower.
