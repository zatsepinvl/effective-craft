## The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct For Professional Programmers
by Robert C. Martin 

### 1. Professionalism

#### Taking Responsibility
- Take responsibility and accountability.
- Imagine sometimes that it is your own money burned due to a bug.
- As a professional when you make a mistake, you must clean up the mess.

#### Do not harm
- Practise merciless refactoring - remember the Boy Scout rule.
- Software is too complex to create without bugs.
- QA should find nothing.
- You must known it works.
- You must to be able to execute tests on a whim.
- If you want your software to be flexibly, you have to flex it! 
The only way to prove that your software is easy to change to make easy changes to it.

#### Work Ethic
- Commit the principles and patterns of software design to memory and strive to conform your software to them.
- It is not your employer's responsibility to give you time you need to learn.
- Do not entrust your career to your employer.
- 40 hours a week are for your employer / 20 hours a week are for you.
- Be conversant with:
    - Design patterns: GOF book, POSA book;
    - Design principles: SOLID;
    - Methods: XP, Scrum, Lean, Kaban, Waterfall, Structured Analysis, Structured Design;
    - Disciplines: TDD, OOD, CI;
    - Artifacts: UML, DFDs, Petri Nets, State Transition Diagrams and Tables.
- Do not stop learning.
- Do not stop practicing.
- Collaborate.
- Be a mentor.
- Know your domain.
- Identify with employer/customer.
- Be humble.
- Never demean another for making a mistake.
- Never ridicule others.

### 2. Saying No

#### Adversarial Roles
- Professionals speak truth to power.
- Do not hesitate to say no and face confrontation, 
the hard decisions are best made through the confrontation of adversarial roles.
- Do not provide too much details in case of adversarial conversation as it can be an invitation for micro-management.

#### High Stakes
- The most important time to say no is when the stakes are highest.
- The higher the stakes, the more valuable "no" becomes.

#### Being a "Team Player"
- Keen on being a team player.
- Use every means in your power to help teammates, managers and customer.
- Forget about trying. Either you do or you do not.
- Be open, there is no place or time for passive aggression.

#### The Cost of Saying Yes
- Strive to find a way to say YES.
- The clients never care as much as you do.

#### Code Impossible
- Do not be tempted to be a hero or jedi.
- Never drop your disciplines. It is not the way to solve problems.
- Good code and professionalism are possible.

### 3. Saying Yes

#### A Language of Commitment
- Make a commitment effectively:
    1. You say you'll do it.
    2. You mean it.
    3. You actually do it.
- Recognize lack of commitment around you, and in you.
- Change your language of commitment to solve the communication problem.
- Professionals live up to their words.

#### Learning How to Say "Yes"
- Instead of committing to do impossible work (or if it depends on someone else), you should commit to these specific actions that bring you closer to the end goal.
- Change expectations as soon as possible.
- Do not abuse the word try. Say it clear, either you will or you wont.
- Do not break disciplines, it only slows you down.
- All commitments we make should be subordinate to the committed disciplines.
- Professionals know their limits.

### 4. Coding
#### Preparedness
- Firstly, you must understand what problem you are solving. 
- Secondly, you must understand how to solve that problem.
- Your code must fit well into the existing system.
- You must craft the code in such a way that it reveals your intent.

#### Interruptions
- If you are tired or destructed, do not code. Dedication and professionalism are more about discipline that hours.
- Professional developers allocate their personal time in order to ensure that the time spent at office is as productive as possible.
- The professional attitude is a polite willingness to be helpful.

#### Creativity
- Remember that creativity breeds creativity.

#### Debugging
- It is incumbent upon you as a professional to reduce your debugging time as close to zero as you can get.

#### Pacing Yourself
- You must conserve your energy and creativity with the same care.
- Learn your patterns of creativity and brilliance, and take advantage of them rather than work against them.
- Disengagement allows your mind to hunt for solutions in a different and more creative way.
- Sometimes the best way to solve a problem is to go home, eat dinner, watch TV, go to bed, and then wake up the next morning and take a shower.

#### Being Late
- Do not incorporate hope into your estimates. Hope is a project killer.
- Do not let anyone else have hope.
- Hold your estimates.
- Do not be tempted to rush.
- Never buckle under pressure and agree to try to make the deadline.
- You should not agree to work unless
    1. You can personally afford it;
    2. It is short term, two weeks or less;
    3. Your boss/manager has a fall-back plan in case the overtime effort fails.
 - Avoid the problem of false delivery by creating an independent definition of "done".
 
#### Help
 - No matter how skilled you are, you will certainly benefit from another programmer's thoughts and ideas.
 - As a professional you are honor bound to offer that help whenever it is needed.
 - Fresh perspective can be a profound catalyst for solving problems.
 - As you are honor bound to offer help, you are honor bound to accept help. Be gracious about it.
 - It is unprofessional to remain stuck when help is easily accessible.
 - As a professional you should train less experienced programmers. 
 
### 5. Test Driven Development

#### The Jury Is In
- TDD works.

#### The Three Laws of TDD
- You are not allowed to write any production code until you have first written a failing unit test.
- You are not allowed to write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail - and not compiling is failing.
- You are not allowed to write more production code that is sufficient to pass the current failing unit test.

#### The Litany Of Benefits
- *Certainty*. You will write dozens of tests every day. If you keep all of them on hand, you will be certain that your code really works.
- *Defect Injection Rate*. There are several facts of defect reduction by IBM, Microsoft and other companies.
- *Courage*. When you have a suit of tests that you trust, then you lose all fear of making changes and cleaning code.
- *Documentation*. The unit tests are documents that describe the lowest-level design of the system.
- *Design*. The need to test first forces you to think about good design.

#### What TDD Is Not
- You can still write bad code even if you write your tests first, you can write bad tests.
- No professional developer should ever follow a discipline when that discipline does more harm than good.

### 6. Practicing
- Again, never stop practicing.
- Practice on your own time. It is not your employer job to help you to keep your skills sharp for you.

#### The Coding Dojo
- Doing anything quickly requires practice.
- Choose a repertoire of problem/solution paris and execute them over and over again until you know them cold.
- Practice Kata.
- Practise Wasa.
- Practise Randori.

#### Broadening Your Experience
- Diverse your experience.
- Contribute to an open-source project.
- Do not use the same language or platform that you use at work.
