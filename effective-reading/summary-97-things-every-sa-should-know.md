# [97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know](http://www.uni-obuda.hu/users/boraros-bakucz.andras/2014/methodology/97%20Things%20Every%20Software%20Architect%20Should%20Know.pdf)


### 1. Don't put your resume ahead of the requirements (Nitin Borwankar).
### 2. Simplify essential complexity; diminish accidental complexity (Neal Ford).
### 3. Chances are, your biggest problem isn’t technical (Mark Ramm).
### 4. Communication is king; clarity and leadership, its humble servants (Mark Richards).
### 5. Application architecture determines application performance (Randy Stafford).
1. Appreciate that application architecture is the primary determinant of application performance
and scalability.
2. If the deployment of an application is insufficiently
architected for the expected load, or if the application’s functional architecture
is too inefficient in its utilization of computing resources, then no amount of
“tuning” will bring about the desired performance and scalability characteristics

### 6. Seek the value in requested capabilities (Einar Landre).
### 7. Stand Up! (Udi Dahan). 
### 8. Everything will ultimately fail (Michael Nygard).
1. Accept the your system (software, hardware) inevitably fail.
2. Design and implement safe failure modes in advance (see crumple zones).

### 9. You’re negotiating more often than you think (Michael Nygard).
1. Dont make concessions on the first demand.
2. Look for a collaborative solution-finding exercise.
3. We’re trained as engineers, and engineering is all about making tradeoffs.
4. Negotiate win-win solution without being passive aggressive.

### 10. Quantify (Keith Braithwaite).
1. If performance matters, ask for exact numbers: 
    How many? 
    In what period? 
    How often? 
    How soon? 
    Increasing or decreasing? 
    At what rate? 
  Reject “Lots” and “soon” as answers.
2. If performance doesn't matter, ensure for that and then focuse on aspects of the system that are worth paying for.  

### 11. One line of working code is worth 500 of specification (Keith Braithwaite).
1. Design matters, but the fact is that specifications alone have no value. The ultimate goal of a software project is a production system.
2. No design is perfect from the start; all designs need to be modified as they are implemented.
3. Listen to the team who work on implementing your vision or better try to programm it on your own.

### 12. There is no one-size-fits-all solution (Randy Stafford). 
1. Architects must contininuosly develop and exercise "contextual sense".
2. (system architecting) The most important knowledge of software patterns is the knowledge of when
to apply them and when not to apply them depending on the context.
3. (problem analysis) Root cause hypotheses and associated corrective actions during problem analysis depend on the context.
4. **Problem analysis and system architecting requires accumulated contextual sense.**
