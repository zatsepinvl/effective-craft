##### 1. Don't put your resume ahead of the requirements (Nitin Borwankar).
##### 2. Simplify essential complexity; diminish accidental complexity (Neal Ford).
##### 3. Chances are, your biggest problem isn’t technical (Mark Ramm).
##### 4. Communication is king; clarity and leadership, its humble servants (Mark Richards).
##### 5. Application architecture determines application performance (Randy Stafford).
##### 6. Seek the value in requested capabilities (Einar Landre).
##### 7. Stand Up! (Udi Dahan). 
##### 8. Everything will ultimately fail (Michael Nygard).
    1. Accept the your system (software, hardware) inevitably fail.
    2. Design and implement safe failure modes in advance (see crumple zones).
##### 9. You’re negotiating more often than you think (Michael Nygard).
    1. Dont make concessions on the first demand.
    2. Look for a collaborative solution-finding exercise.
    3. We’re trained as engineers, and engineering is all about making tradeoffs.
    4. Negotiate win-win solution without being passive aggressive.
##### 10. Quantify (Keith Braithwaite).
    1. If performance matters, ask for exact numbers: 
        How many? 
        In what period? 
        How often? 
        How soon? 
        Increasing or decreasing? 
        At what rate? 
      Reject “Lots” and “soon” as answers.
    2. If performance doesn't matter, ensure for that and then focuse on aspects of the system that are worth paying for.
